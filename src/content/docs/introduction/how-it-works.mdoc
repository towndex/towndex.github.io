Towndex works by:
1. **extracting and synthesizing** information from local government documents
2. **integrating** information from multiple documents
3. **generating** a browsable and searchable website using that information

## 1. Extraction and synthesis

Towndex extracts the content of a document and uses a [large language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) to synthesize a [schema.org](https://schema.org)-based [knowledge graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph) reflecting document contents.

REPORTS:
Town Clerk: Rebecca Del Gaizo
Ms. Del Gaizo gave the report for the month of December. $7,441.77 will be remitted to the
Supervisor's office. Rounding numbers, recycling fees accounted for $6,022, Community Center
fees for $800.00, Dog License fees for $220.00 and $399.00 in miscellaneous fees making up the
balance. The Community Center had 4 new reservations. Our share of $1,330.59 in DEC sales
was $24.41. Motion to accept the report was made by Councilman Cipperly and seconded by
Councilman Balistreri. Unanimously approved. A copy of the written report is on file in the
Town Clerk's Office.

## 2. Integration

Towndex coalesces the synthesized knowledge graphs derived from different documents into a single knowledge graph. [Events](https://schema.org/Event), [reports](https://schema.org/Report), and other transient entities are identified within the namespaces of documents, while [organizations](https://schema.org/Organization), [people](https://schema.org/Person), [places](https://schema.org/Place), and other permanent entities have identifiers in a global namespace.

## 3. Site generation

Finally, Towndex generates a static website from the integrated knowledge graph using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). The website can be deployed to any static file host, such as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) (free) or [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (low cost).

A [demo site](https://towndex.github.io/us-ny-brunswick/en) for the town of Brunswick, NY is hosted on GitHub Pages.
