Local government decisions significantly impact our lives but rarely make the news. Meeting minutes, forms, and other documents published by local governments are generally available online, but are often:

* Dispersed across multiple websites
* Dispersed across many pages of a website
* Inconsistently organized and published
* In PDF or Word format instead of HTML
* Couched in bureaucratic or esoteric language

Towndex **helps citizens learn about the business of local government** by extracting, integrating, and presenting information from government documents in a way that's browsable and searchable. A Towndex site can help answer questions like:

* What issues were considered by the town government?
* What decisions were made?
* Who is involved? (people and organizations)
* Which geographic areas of the town are affected?
* How much money has been collected and expended?
