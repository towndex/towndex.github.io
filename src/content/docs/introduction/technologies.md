Towndex is built on a range of technologies suited to different purposes. The source for Towndex is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/imlapps/sdapps) under an [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

[Extraction and synthesis of knowledge graphs](/introduction/how-it-works/#1-extraction-and-synthesis) is implemented in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) to run on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). The code uses [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org) to convert rich documents to PDFs (as needed), [Amazon Textract](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/index.html) to extract HTML from PDFs, and the [Vercel AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev) to access large language model APIs in order to synthesize [schema.org](https://schema.org)-based knowledge graphs serialized in [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/). In a postprocessing step the code converts JSON-LD to [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) and cleans the latter. The knowledge graphs are validated against [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) shapes with a SHACL validator. 

[Static site generation](/introduction/how-it-works/#3-site-generation) is implemented in TypeScript using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [React.js](https://react.dev), and [Mantine](https://mantine.dev). The Towndex Next.js app works with schema.org-based knowledge graphs via an abstraction layer of TypeScript classes generated by [SHACLmate](https://github.com/minorg/shaclmate). 

The [demo site](https://towndex.github.io/us-ny-brunswick/en) is deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) with a [custom, Docker-based action](https://github.com/towndex/action).
